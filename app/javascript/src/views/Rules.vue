    <div>
      <b class="text-lg">Introduction</b>
      <p>
        <b>Imperial</b> is a board game in which you play as an investor in pre-World War I European imperial powers. Players own bonds in various countries and whoever owns the majority stake in a country controls that country.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each country takes their turn to do one action on the <b>rondel</b>. Whoever happens to control that country when it is the country's turn is the person who decides what that country will do on that turn. Countries gain <b>power points</b> (which are increased by building factories and conquering territory). The first country to gain <b>25 power points</b> signals the end of the game. The winner of the game is determined by evaluating the bonds controlled by each player and calculating who has the most valuable portfolio.
