    <b class="text-xl">How to Play Imperial</b>
    <div>
      <b class="text-lg">Introduction</b>
      <p>
        <b>Imperial</b> is a board game in which you play as an investor in pre-World War I European imperial powers. Players own bonds in various countries and whoever owns the majority stake in a country controls that country.
      </p>
      <p>
      Each country takes their turn to do one action on the <b>rondel</b>. Whoever happens to control that country when it is the country's turn is the person who decides what that country will do on that turn. Countries gain <b>power points</b> (which are increased by building factories and conquering territory). The first country to gain <b>25 power points</b> signals the end of the game. The winner of the game is determined by evaluating the bonds controlled by each player and calculating who has the most valuable portfolio.

      <b class="text-lg">The Game Turn</b>
      <div>
        <b>Production</b>
        <p>
          Unoccupied factories produce a unit. Blue factories produce fleets and black factories produce armies.
        </p>
        <b>Factory</b>
        <p>
          Nation builds a factory for 5m.
        </p>
        <b>Import</b>
        <p>
          Nation may purchase up to 3 units for 1m each, to be placed anywhere in their home territory.
        </p>
        <b>Maneuver</b>
        <p>
          Units may move. Fleets must move first, followed by armies.
        </p>
        <b>Maneuver - Railroad Rule</b>
        <p>
          On a maneuver turn, an army may move inside their own home territory for free, in addition to being able to move to one adjacent land region. If a home province is occupied by a foreign power, the railroad network is not operational and armies may only move to one adjacent land region.
        </p>
        <b>Manuever - Convoy</b>
        <p>
          Armies may use fleets to cross ocean regions. One fleet may only convoy one army per turn.
        </p>
        <b>Maneuver - Fighting and Coexisting</b>
        <p>
          When moving into a region occupied by another power, you will be given a choice of either <b>fighting</b> or <b>coexisting</b>. If you fight, your unit and one of their units will be removed from the board. If you coexist, both units remain but the dot on the region will not change.
        </p>
        <b>Maneuver - Placing a Dot</b>
        <p>
          If a nation has the only units in a neutral region (ie, one which is not a home province of another nation), the neutral region will acquire a dot in the color representing that nation.
        </p>
        <b>Investor</b>
        <p>
          Nation pays players interest, investor card holder receives 2m and may purchase a bond, Swiss Banks may invest.
        </p>
        <b>Taxation</b>
        <p>
          Player receives tax (2m per unoccupied factory and 1m per dot) from the nation. Power points are increased and nation receives tax, less soldiers' pay (1m per unit).
